# CyberNews VPN Rankings â€“ UI Redesign

## Overview
This static site is a modern, responsive redesign of the CyberNews VPN rankings page.
 It presents VPN providers with rankings, features, ratings, and calls-to-action using a clean, minimalistic design.

## Design Choices
- **Modern Typography & Spacing:**  
  We use the `Inter` and `Space Grotesk` fonts for a clean, legible look. Increased padding and margins enhance readability.
  
- **Responsive Layout:**  
  CSS Grid and media queries ensure the page looks great on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
  
- **Animations & Interactivity:**  
  Cards fade and slide into view on scroll. Hover effects on cards and buttons add subtle interactivity.
  
- **Sticky Promo Banner:**  
  A fixed promo banner at the bottom provides a persistent call-to-action.
  
- **Performance Optimization:**  
  Lazy-loading for images and minimal JavaScript ensure fast load times and smooth interactions.

## Files
- **index.html:** Contains the main HTML structure.
- **styles.css:** Contains all the CSS for styling and responsiveness.
- **script.js:** Provides smooth scrolling, lazy loading, animations, and CTA tracking.
- **README.md:** Explains design choices and project overview.

## How to Use
Unzip the folder and open `index.html` in your browser to see the redesigned page.
